I am an undergraduate student going into my second year of studying towards a Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Cyber Security at Nottingham Trent University. I have a strong interest in a variety of computing fields and have dedicated a lot of my free time to expanding my knowledge which I have applied to my academic studies and several personal projects.
